   The boundary is a property of the *forms* a file contains, not of its text:
   a `js/` sequence inside a docstring, comment, or string literal performs no
   interop and must not fail the package lint. Every check here therefore runs
   over parsed source.

   The policy is runtime-neutral and carries no filesystem access, so the same
   rules are verified under Babashka, NBB, and Shadow CLJS. Walking a directory
   tree and choosing an exit code belong to the host entrypoint,
