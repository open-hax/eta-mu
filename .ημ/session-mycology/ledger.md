  note: Bulk note organization is safely scriptable once categories and slugs are decided; embedding metadata in the script keeps the operation reproducible.

  p-efficiency: 0.5
  p-friction: 0.7
  p-skill-candidate: 0.8
  spore: none
  receipt-refs: none
  note: Many bracket errors from AI-generated code. CLJS interop gotchas: Map.size is property not method, Segmenter returns iterable not iterator, StringBuffer doesn't exist in Node.js. Pattern: systematic bracket audit + CLJS JS interop idiom checklist.

  note: Extensions returned #js {:content ...} but OpenCode expects Promise<string>. Fix was small (result->string + wrap-execute) but required tracing the full loading chain. Pattern: OpenCode plugin API contract mismatch.

  p-skill-candidate: 0.5
  spore: none
  receipt-refs: board-triage-2026-07-19
  note: eta-mu kanban frontmatter now enforces the rheos FSM — closing a card means walking valid edges (breakdown->ready->todo->in_progress->testing->review->document->done); direct-to-done is rejected. Also `kanban find <uuid>` returns full card JSON, not a matches wrapper.

  spore: none
  receipt-refs: contracts-git-ref-extraction-eta-mu-consumers
  note: Cards in `testing` may carry stale package names in their gate commands (@open-hax/* -> @eta-mu/* rename); resolve names from package.json before declaring a filter miss a failure. Rheos dropped event-ledger for protocols' EDN event-admission — epic criteria can be satisfied by dep removal, not just git-ref.

  receipt-refs: sol-katamorph-schema-cutover
  note: Writing the first-ever validation test for a schema kind exposed a latent invalid-ref bug (katamorph :policy children ref never resolved) — canon cutover work should sweep EVERY registry kind with at least one validate test, not just the kinds the consumer uses. Also — cwd drifts across Bash calls after cd; use absolute paths.

  spore: none
  receipt-refs: event-ledger-envelope-truth
  note: Serialization bugs hide when tests assert on the RETURNED value instead of the WRITTEN artifact — always round-trip through the real boundary (raw insertOne payload, the committed dist). Also — mixing shadow-cljs release+compile builds can leave a stale cache producing phantom 'cljs$core$IFn undefined' test errors; rm -rf .shadow-cljs target and rebuild before diagnosing.
